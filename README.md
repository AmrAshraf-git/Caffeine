## Overview
☕️ Caffeine – A Fun Animated Coffee App with Jetpack Compose

Welcome to **Caffeine**!  
This is a small, just-for-fun Android app exploring Jetpack Compose's UI animation and navigation capabilities, all wrapped in a playful "make your coffee" experience.

## Features

- 🎨 **Beautiful Animation**:  
  - Animated transitions between screens (slide & fade)
  - Falling coffee beans effect as you select roasts
  - Buttons & AppBar slide in dynamically for extra polish

- 🛤️ **Modern Navigation**:  
  Smooth screen-to-screen navigation using the new Compose Navigation Animation APIs (no external libs required).

- 🛠 **Modular & Clean Code**:  
  Project is organized by feature, with clear separation for navigation, screens, and composables.

- 🤹‍♂️ **Just for Fun!**  
  Caffeine is a playful demo project and not intended for production or real-world orders (unless you want to hack it further!).
